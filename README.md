### Work on the branch that you've created (should be in format: ui/your-short-name-issue e.g. ui/asf-create-login-page (same for HOTFIX for bugs, FEATURE for implementing issues with 'Create' key)

### After you've done working on the branch, please add it, commit it and push it on the github repository.

### Manually create 'Pull Request' and let the others review the code that you've written.
